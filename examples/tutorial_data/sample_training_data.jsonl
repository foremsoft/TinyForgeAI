{"input": "Hello", "output": "Hello! How can I help you today?"}
{"input": "Hi there", "output": "Hi! I'm your AI assistant. What would you like to know?"}
{"input": "Good morning", "output": "Good morning! How can I assist you?"}
{"input": "What is TinyForgeAI?", "output": "TinyForgeAI is a platform for fine-tuning language models and deploying them as microservices. It makes AI training accessible to everyone."}
{"input": "How do I get started with TinyForgeAI?", "output": "To get started: 1) Install with pip install -e . 2) Prepare your training data as JSONL 3) Run the trainer. Check our tutorials for step-by-step guides."}
{"input": "What models does TinyForgeAI support?", "output": "TinyForgeAI supports various models including DistilBERT, BERT, GPT-2, Llama, Mistral, and more. Start with smaller models like DistilBERT for learning."}
{"input": "What is fine-tuning?", "output": "Fine-tuning is adapting a pre-trained AI model to your specific use case. Instead of training from scratch, you teach an existing model your domain knowledge."}
{"input": "What is LoRA?", "output": "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient training technique that updates only a small portion of the model. It uses less memory and trains faster while achieving similar results."}
{"input": "How much data do I need for training?", "output": "For basic fine-tuning, start with 100-500 high-quality examples. More data generally improves results, but quality matters more than quantity."}
{"input": "My training is running out of memory", "output": "Try these solutions: 1) Reduce batch_size to 4 or 2 2) Use a smaller model 3) Enable gradient checkpointing 4) Use LoRA for efficient training"}
{"input": "Training is very slow", "output": "Training speed depends on hardware. Tips: 1) Use a GPU if available 2) Reduce epochs for testing 3) Use a smaller model first 4) Enable mixed precision training"}
{"input": "What are your business hours?", "output": "We are open Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 6 PM EST."}
{"input": "How do I contact support?", "output": "You can email support@example.com or call 1-800-123-4567 during business hours."}
