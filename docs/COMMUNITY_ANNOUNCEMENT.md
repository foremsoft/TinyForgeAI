**Title:** [P] TinyForgeAI - Open source framework for training tiny LLMs - Looking for contributors!

```
Hey everyone!

I'm excited to share TinyForgeAI, an open-source framework we've been building for training small, focused language models from your own data.

**The Problem:**
Large LLMs are powerful but overkill (and expensive) for most tasks. Sometimes you just need a small model trained on your specific data.

**What TinyForgeAI Does:**
- Connects to your data sources (databases, Google Docs, Notion, PDFs, APIs)
- Trains tiny models using HuggingFace Transformers + LoRA
- Exports to ONNX and generates a complete FastAPI microservice
- Includes RAG support for document search

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- HuggingFace Transformers/PEFT
- FastAPI
- React dashboard
- Docker/Kubernetes ready

**We're Looking for Contributors!**

Whether you're a beginner or experienced, there's something for you:

- **Beginners:** We have "good first issue" labels and detailed contributing docs
- **Backend devs:** New connectors, training improvements
- **Frontend devs:** React dashboard enhancements
- **ML engineers:** Model optimization, new architectures
- **Tech writers:** Documentation and tutorials

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/foremsoft/TinyForgeAI
- Good First Issues: https://github.com/foremsoft/TinyForgeAI/labels/good%20first%20issue
- Contributing Guide: https://github.com/foremsoft/TinyForgeAI/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

Happy to answer any questions!

**Title:** Show HN: TinyForgeAI – Train tiny LLMs from your data, deploy as microservices

```
Hi HN!

TinyForgeAI is an open-source framework for training small, focused language models from your own data.

The idea: Large LLMs are overkill for most enterprise use cases. Sometimes you just need a 100M parameter model trained on your company's FAQs.

Features:
- Connect to DBs, Google Docs, Notion, PDFs, APIs
- Train with HuggingFace + LoRA (or dry-run mode)
- Export to ONNX + generate FastAPI service
- React dashboard for non-technical users
- RAG support for document search

We're actively looking for contributors. We have good-first-issue labels and comprehensive docs.

GitHub: https://github.com/foremsoft/TinyForgeAI

Would love feedback and contributions!
